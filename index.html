                Across Healthcare has created a powerful platform to help patients, 
                caregivers, patient advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers become 
                unified in their daily pursuits. Easily capture, track, and action any

                <p>The Across Healthcare team has had experience building many healthcare and 
                    research systems around the world, and they knew privacy, security, and 
                    regulatory compliance needed to be of top importance; therefore, Matrix is 
                    HIPAA, GDPR, and 21 CFR Part 112 compliant. Many other aspects such as 
                    internationalization, accessibility, and interoperability are accounted for 
                    at the core of the Matrix architecture.</p>

            <p>Typically, a rare disease patient has mutliple clinicians, and
                Matrix helps bridge connectivity and continuity with all of them
                by using the following methods and models:

                    <p>Through the patient’s Sharing Center, Matrix allows for 
                        sharing of a timebound, password-protected link. This 
                        link will allow read-only access to any patient-permissioned 
                        data. This could be used at an urgent care clinic, emergency

                        the platform directly. Once activated as a physician, patients can 
                        associate themselves with a clinician and share permissioned data. 
                        This maybe used by a primary care clinician or other specialist whom 
                        a patient frequently sees. These Clinicians can use Matrix to see
